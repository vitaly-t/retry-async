# retry-async

Straight up retry-async optimized implementation for copy-n-paste, without any nonsense.

Just copy [./src/retry-async.ts](./src/retry-async.ts) into your project, and you're good to go ;)

Function `retryAsync` there is self-explanatory, and that is all you need.

Tested with TypeScript 5.x, in strict mode.

To run [./src/test.ts](./src/test.ts), install dependencies via `npm i`, and then do `npm test`.
