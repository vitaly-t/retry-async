# retry-async

Optimized retry-async implementation for copy-n-paste (no library). See [the original gist](https://gist.github.com/vitaly-t/6e3d285854d882b1618c7e435df164c4). 

Just copy [./src/retry-async.ts](./src/retry-async.ts) file into your project, and you're good to go ;)

Function `retryAsync` there is self-explanatory, and that is all you need.

Tested with TypeScript 5.x, in strict mode.

To run [./src/test.ts](./src/test.ts), install dependencies via `npm i`, and then do `npm test`.
